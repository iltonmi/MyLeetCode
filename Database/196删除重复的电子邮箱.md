1. 子查询，先按email分组，取出每组的最小id

   ```mysql
   DELETE P1
   FROM Person AS P1,
       (
       SELECT MIN(P.id) AS `Id`,P.Email
       FROM Person AS P
       GROUP BY P.email
       ) AS P2
   WHERE P1.Id != P2.Id AND P1.Email = P2.Email
   ```

   

   ```mysql
   DELETE P1
   FROM Person AS P1 
   JOIN 
       (
       SELECT MIN(P.id) AS `Id`,P.Email
       FROM Person AS P
       GROUP BY P.email
       ) AS P2
   ON (P1.Id != P2.Id AND P1.Email = P2.Email)
   ```

   

2. 直接join

   ```mysql
   DELETE P1
   FROM Person AS P1 JOIN Person AS P2 ON (P1.email = P2.email AND P1.id > P2.id)
   ```

   

3. left join，删除差集

   ```mysql
   DELETE U
   FROM Person AS U
   LEFT JOIN
   (
   	SELECT MIN(id) AS `id`,email
   	FROM Person
   	GROUP BY email
   ) AS A ON (U.email = A.email AND U.id = A.id)
   WHERE A.id IS NULL
   ```

4. not in

   ```mysql
   DELETE FROM Person
   WHERE Id NOT IN (
       SELECT T.Id 
       FROM(
           SELECT MIN(Id) AS Id
           FROM Person
           GROUP BY Email
       ) AS T
   )
   ```
