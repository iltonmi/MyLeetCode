# [262. 行程和用户](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/trips-and-users/)

1. 使用not in，直接去除被禁止的用户

   ```mysql
   select t.Request_at as 'Day', round(
       sum(if(t.Status != 'completed', 1, 0)) / count(*), 2) as 'Cancellation Rate'
   from Trips as t
   where Client_Id not in (
       select Users_Id
       from Users
       where Role = 'client' and Banned = 'Yes'
       )
       and
       Driver_Id not in (
           select Users_Id
           from Users
           where Role = 'driver' and Banned = 'Yes'
       )
       -- 上面2个子查询中，对role的检查可以省略，因为1个id只有一种角色
       and
       t.Request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
   group by t.Request_at
   ```

   

2.  使用join去除被禁止的用户

   https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/trips-and-users/solution/san-chong-jie-fa-cong-nan-dao-yi-zong-you-gua-he-n/ 
   
   ```mysql
   SELECT T.request_at AS `Day`, 
   	ROUND(
   			SUM(
   				IF(T.STATUS = 'completed',0,1)
   			)
   			/ 
   			COUNT(T.STATUS),
   			2
   	) AS `Cancellation Rate`
   FROM Trips AS T
   -- assert 某个id的user不可能既是client又是driver
   JOIN Users AS U1 ON (T.client_id = U1.users_id AND U1.banned ='No')
   JOIN Users AS U2 ON (T.driver_id = U2.users_id AND U2.banned ='No')
   WHERE T.request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
GROUP BY T.request_at
   ```
